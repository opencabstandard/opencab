    <p><a href="https://opencabstandard.org/">OpenCab</a> is a set of interface definitions that permit multiple mobile apps running on a single device to communicate with each other at runtime to present a seamless experience for the driver. It's designed to serve truck drivers and other field users who drive vehicles as a key part of their jobs.</p>

    <p>Although this documentation is in the form of a Java API, OpenCab isn't an SDK. Instead, it's a set of agreed-upon Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">Intent</a>s and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider">ContentProvider</a>s that, if implemented according to the definitions documented here, permit cross-app communication of structured data without a proprietary SDK.</p>

    <p>Check out {@link org.opencabstandard.provider} for the technical details about the types of data that can be shared between apps.</p>

    <p>We welcome pull requests to propose backwards-compatible changes to the spec, clarifications to the spec, and improvements to the sample code via <a href="https://github.com/opencabstandard/opencab">GitHub.</a></p>

    <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/opencabstandard/opencab/edit/master/website/overview.html">propose changes to this file</a> directly.</p>
